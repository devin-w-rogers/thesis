# Senior Thesis Project 

### Introduction

In this project, I will be building a webapp, containerizing it using Docker, and deploying it to a Kubernetes cluster. The webapp will be some sort of CV/resume for my personal use. I am doing this for two reasons: 
1. I think having a personal resume in the format of a website will be very useful. I also want to learn more web development skills in general.
2. I'd like to learn more about Kubernetes and Docker.
